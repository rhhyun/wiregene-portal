# Synology Portal Service

This package runs `portal.wiregene.com` as a separate Synology Docker service.

## Install

```sh
/bin/sh /volume1/docker/wiregene-portal/scripts/synology-update-portal.sh
```

On the first run, fill `/volume1/docker/portal/.env`, then run the same command
again.

The default service listens on host port `3002`.

## DSM Task Scheduler

Use this single command for manual or scheduled updates:

```sh
cd /volume1/docker/wiregene-portal && git pull --ff-only origin main && /bin/sh /volume1/docker/wiregene-portal/scripts/synology-update-portal.sh
```

The update script pulls the latest source, builds before restarting the service,
recreates the container only after a successful build, checks local HTTP
readiness, verifies the rendered `Ver x.y` label when Basic Auth credentials are
available, checks that the public `portal.wiregene.com` route is not still served
by Vercel, and writes a timestamped log under `/volume1/docker/portal/logs`.

If the public route check reports Vercel headers, the local Synology container
was updated correctly but browsers are still reaching Vercel. Fix Cloudflare DNS
and the DSM reverse proxy first, then remove the Vercel alias for
`portal.wiregene.com`.

## Required Source

The shared GitHub source should exist at:

```text
/volume1/docker/wiregene-portal
```

Change `APP_SOURCE_DIR` in `.env` if the checkout lives elsewhere.
